## TODO

- [x] stub local storage (drawings count and maybe name later)
- [x] present a diff success prompt to ppl w ls
  - [x] dont ask ppl for email if they've already given me some email

- [ ] can't sign up w dupe/existing email (silent success)
- [x] include election question in email so that the award actually makes sense

- [ ] FEATURE: add kidpixy sound effects (save success, drawing(mousedown on canvas that repeats), pick color(sorta acts like a ghetto keyboard)). sound feedback for fun and speed perception (see also Nintendo Switch UI)
  - [ ] üé∂ get sounds (select color, switch palettes, drag on canvas, voted)

- bug: drawing grid broken at a middle small viewport (convert to % based?)

questions:
----------
- add json feed support to/notify me whenever someone adds a new drawing? use case: cuz it's so easy. fun to say i've added it to frogfeels before adding it to blog. so easy to make, why not make it? FF now has it's own json feed for new drawings added, I don't know what you'd use it for - but it's there!
